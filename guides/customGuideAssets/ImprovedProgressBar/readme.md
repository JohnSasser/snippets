# Custom Progress Bar

Create a new guide and add a code block and add the codes in it, save this step.

Then keep duplicating this first step and make changes in the html in the first line for the increment in percentage based on the number of steps you are going to have along with the text for steps in line 3.

For example, your guide will have 6 steps then each step should increment by 16.66 %

First step - 16.66%
Second step - 33.33% and so on.
