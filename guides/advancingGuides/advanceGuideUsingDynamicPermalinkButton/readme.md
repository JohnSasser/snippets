# Using hidden metadata within the guide containers HTML to use in the guide permalinks url as dynamics placeholder.

This can be used in situations where you want to redirect a user to a different page and trigger the guide automatically using a button in a another guide  or from an resource center module such as **onboarding module**.

This helps in reducing the count of steps needs to be taken before reaching to the target page to start the actual guide journey.
